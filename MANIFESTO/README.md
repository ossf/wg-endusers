# The Open Source Consumption Manifesto
_v 0.0 (public draft)_

Open source is simultaneously a public good and a good of the public.

Open source doesn’t owe anything to an individual or organization.  

The availability, value, and quality of open source are not guaranteed.

### As consumers of open source, we are responsible for *the open source we use*, *how we consume it*, and *how we manage the risk associated with that consumption*.

### We seek to...

1. Prioritize secure consumption of open source components
2. Be aware and considerate of the developer experience
3. Build upon iterative policy-based foundations and best practices. 

### We call on commercial and non-commercial development organizations to…

* Accept open source software consumption as critical to building a secure software supply chain.
<br>

* Ensure that open source software consumption is balanced against a defined risk profile which can depend on risk tolerance, regulatory context, etc.
<br>

* Recognize potential risks associated with open source consumption, including vulnerabilities, malicious software and appropriateness of component choice.
<br>

* Acknowledge that not all vulnerabilities are actively curated, and the scoring systems (such as  CVSS used for CVEs) can be a trailing indicator.
<br>

* Improve open source software consumption via audit and quarantine functionality for components matching known vulnerabilities and malicious packages.
<br> 

* Focus on tools and processes that support and extend the abilities of development teams/developers to make informed evaluations of consumed open source software.
<br>

* Protect software organizations and development teams from malicious software by supporting established security models (e.g., SLSA, S2C2F, etc.) and then applying those models to the consumption of open source.
<br>

* Establish an open source consumption policy and regularly test against tolerance for risk, impact on development teams, and other goals.
<br>

* Work with teams to design and implement mindful control points for open source consumption throughout the SDLC.
<br>

* Adopt and develop open source consumption management tooling and processes that support a recall ability similar to those in other industries.
<br>

* Ensure consumed open source components are appropriately lifecycle managed and that consuming developer teams are using latest, LTS, or otherwise "supported" releases where practical.
<br>

* Engage with the upstream developers of consumed components, especially for components which form a critical part of your project, to report issues, fix bugs, support development, etc.
