# The Open Source Consumption Manifesto
_v 0.0 (public draft)_

Open source is simultaneously a public good and a good of the public.

Open source doesn’t owe anything to an individual or organization.  

The availability, value, and quality of open source are not guaranteed.

### As consumers of open source, we are responsible for *the open source we use*, *how we consume it*, and *how we manage the risk associated with that consumption*.

### We seek to...

1. Prioritize secure consumption of open source components
2. Be aware and considerate of the developer experience
3. Build upon iterative policy-based foundations and best practices. 

### We call on commercial and non-commercial development organizations to…

* Accept open source software consumption as critical to building a secure software supply chain.
<br>

* Ensure that open source software consumption is balanced against a defined risk profile which can depend on risk tolerance, regulatory context, etc.
<br>

* Recognize potential risks associated with open source consumption, including vulnerabilities, malicious software and component choice.
<br>

* Acknowledge that not all vulnerabilities are actively curated, and the scoring systems (such as  CVSS used for CVEs) can be a trailing indicator.
<br>

* Improve open source consumption via audit and quarantine functionality for components matching known vulnerabilities and malicious packages.
<br> 

* Focus on tools and processes that support and extend the abilities of development teams/developers to make informed evaluations of consumed open source software.
<br>

* Protect software organizations and development teams from malicious software by supporting established security models (e.g., [SLSA], [S2C2F], etc.) and then applying those models to the consumption of open source.
<br>

* Establish an open source consumption policy and regularly test against tolerance for risk, impact on development teams, and other goals.
<br>

* Work with teams to design and implement mindful control points for open source consumption throughout the SDLC.
<br>

* Ensure the lifecycle of consumed open source components is appropriately managed and that consuming developer teams are using latest, LTS, or otherwise "supported" releases where practical.
<br>

* Engage with the upstream developers of consumed components, especially for components which form a critical part of your project, to report issues, fix bugs, support development, etc.
<br>

* Adopt tooling, best practices, and processes to (1) continuously track, monitor, and improve the security of open source software being consumed, (2) respond to security issues more effectively, and (3) facilitate risk communication to customers/partners through existing channels (e.g., CISA's CVD, VEX, etc.).
